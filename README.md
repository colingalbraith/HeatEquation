## Technical Overview


### Neumann Boundary Conditions
The Neumann boundary condition imposes that the gradient (or flux) of the temperature at the boundaries of the domain is zero. Mathematically, this means:
- \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0 \) at the boundary for 1D.
- \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0 \) and \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0 \) at the boundary for 2D.

### Simulation Parameters
- **Thermal Diffusivity (`a`)**: Represents the heat diffusion coefficient. Higher values mean heat spreads faster through the medium.
- **Domain Length (`length`)**: The size of the domain (in mm) through which heat is conducted.
- **Time (`time`)**: The total duration (in seconds) for which the simulation runs.
- **Nodes (`nodes`)**: The number of discrete points in the simulation. Increasing the number of nodes improves accuracy but increases computation time.
- **Time Step (`dt`)**: Calculated to ensure stability in the simulation. Derived from the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition for numerical stability.
- **Forcing Term (`Q`)**: Represents a constant heat source added to the center of the domain to simulate external heating.

### 1D and 2D Simulations
The program simulates the heat equation in both 1D and 2D:

- **1D Simulation**: Models a single rod where heat is applied at the center and propagates outward, with insulated ends.
- **2D Simulation**: Models a flat plate where heat is applied at the center, and the temperature distribution evolves over time across the entire plate.

In both simulations, heat is initially distributed uniformly at 10Â°C. The forcing term (`Q`) applies heat to the center of the domain at each time step, raising the temperature locally.



### Visualizing the Simulation
The program visualizes the temperature distribution as it evolves over time. The plots are updated in real-time, showing:
- **1D Simulation**: A line plot that tracks temperature distribution along the rod over time.
- **2D Simulation**: A heatmap that tracks temperature distribution over the plate.
